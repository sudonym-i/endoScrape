My periods were very heavy and painful right from the start at age 13. I was put on the pill by my GP aged 17 but not investigated. This made things manageable regarding bleeding and flooding, although I had all of the other symptoms described and my periods were always 7-10 days long. Aged 30, the pill just stopped controlling everything and I was bleeding all of the time. I tried different pills, mirena coil (helped for about 18 months, then a replacement coil had to be removed after 6 weeks due to intense pain), until eventually I stopped everything. I was in a job where I could manage my own diary and would schedule/re-schedule appointments accordingly but was always told by the medical profession to just 'live with it'. Eventually, aged 48, I had a hysterectomy and was diagnosed with endometriosis and adenomyosis. To say I felt let down and angry is an understatement - I finally started my life aged 48.

I've had severe back en stomach pain continuously throughout my life, since the age of 14. Periods started only because I got on the pill at age 17. Periods were extremely painful, felt terribly ill everytime for at least 10 days. Got irritable bowl syndrome, intermittent fever syndrome, extreme back pain. The pain kept me up at night for 8 years. Had to stop working. Had surgery 6 months ago: it's a piece of cake compared to the suffering before. The backpain was instantly gone. Had a mass on my uterus and the endometriosis in my uterine bands flipped my uterus, a very painful condition. Endometriose caused adhesions in my lower pelvis. Releasing these adhesions had major impact on bowl symptoms and abdominal and lower back pain.

After around 4 years of being on naproxen (after trying over the counter pain relief) and being diagnosed with “dysmenorrhea/bad period pains” I asked my GP to refer me a gynaecologist! Alongside the severe pains I was experiencing on and around my period, I also experienced vomiting and fainting episodes. I had previously been diagnosed with IBS but have noticed this seems to be at its worst when I am ovulating. After being referred to a gynaecologist and having a laparoscopy, stage 1/2 endo was found. Since surgery I had around 6 months of lessened symptoms and then the pain has gradually increased again over time. However, I have noticed my GP now take my symptoms a lot more seriously following my diagnosis and are more keen to keep on top of my chronic pain.

I had ovulation and period pain since I started periods at 14, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea, but initially it only started the day before my period and only lasted the first 2-3 days. My symptoms gradually got worse, with the pain starting earlier and earlier, then I started getting severe IBS type symptoms. I later developed pain after sex. In the year before diagnosis, I started getting fevers and severe nausea usually during my period, but sometimes a week or so before or after. Eventually I developed a groin swelling along with the fever, my GP insisted I go to A&E but I was told I'd wait all night so I went home and next day had a private MRI and then laparoscopic diagnosis. In Northern Ireland the waiting lists are very long for endometriosis diagnosis, so I self funded private appointments and surgery. I am currently using the combined pill to stop my cycles to hopefully keep the endometriosis lesions from growing and to control my symptoms. I also avoid alcohol and foods high in saturated fat as ingesting those always flares my pain. I eat a plant based diet as dairy causes constipation which also makes my pain worse, and the additional fibre in a plant based diet also helps with the bowel symptoms.

I was diagnosed during Covid, I was referred to a private hospital via the NHS. It was the first time I was really listened to and felt validated. My symptoms became severe in my early 20s and I was diagnosed at 32. Endometriosis is not cyclical, it’s every day. I had a coil which stopped by periods but I had pelvic pain every day. I bled every time I had inercourse and I have IBS symptoms. I’ve had to have a hysterectomy to stop the constant pain and slow down growth.

My periods were regular from the age of 10-16; every three weeks nearly to the day.. When I was 16/17 they became irregular and extremely heavy and painful. I was changing my pad every 1-2 hours and passing large clots. This made me anxious to leave the house on heavy days. Everyone in my family who has periods have all had problems so I thought it was normal and I didn't know better. Doctors said it was probably stress and put me on the pill. I remained on the pill with no questions until I was 24 which is when I began to suspect something was wrong. My pain became worse which included: pelvic pain most of the month, severe bloating, fatigue, nausea, migraines, pain in my back and legs, and pain going to the toilet, especially bowel problems. I fought to have a laparoscopy in April 2019 and was told there was nothing wrong with me when I woke up after the surgery. The gynaecologist who performed the procedure suggested it was a bowel issue and probably IBS. After this, no doctors listened to me even though I was researching every condition I could think of that might be related. I think I saw nearly every GP in the practice, yet not one would refer me back to gynaecology. In 2022, I was fortunate that I was able to see a private gynaecologist who listened to me and agreed that my symptoms were "textbook" endometriosis. She performed a laparoscopy with excision and formally diagnosed me. It was such a relief to be diagnosed because I knew that I wasn't inventing my symptoms and now I have something concrete to work with. After my my second surgery, I was able to manage most days with minimal pain. I began to make plans again and started to reclaim a social life and hobbies. However, earlier on this year my pain levels started to increase. I've recently left my retail job as it was too much to stand all day and am currently seeking a remote or hybrid role to manage my health better. People don't like to hear about others' chronic health problems so I don't talk about it much. However, most of my friends and family are supportive. On a good day I barely notice my symptoms, however on a bad day I start thinking of ways in which I can persuade my GP to refer me back to gynae. I didn't plan on having another surgery so soon, so I'm hoping it won't become an issue just yet.

I lived with extremely painful and heavy periods right from my first one at age 12. The other girls in my class would be sore but I would be in agony, bent double and sobbing in the toilets when a period came. I was basically told I was being dramatic and that every girl has periods, so to just ‘get on with it’. I was on contraception at 13 to try and control the pain. I had significant bladder pain and infections starting when I was late teens and had multiple, invasive and painful procedures on my bladder over a number of years as it was thought I may have painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis. I was hospitalised twice in my early 20s with burst ovarian cysts and was told ‘it’s only a 5cm cyst so it shouldn’t be painful. I don’t know what the issue is’. The hospital then forgot to send any information to my GP and when they took blood again at my surgery, I had them calling within 24 hours to put me immediately onto antibiotics as my inflammation markers were sky high. I came off contraception when I was 30 to try for a baby. I was bent double in agony at this stage and really struggling to function at all. The pain was constant and not just around my period. I was advised the waiting time for gynaecology was months and I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I paid for a consultation. The consultant was 60-70% sure it was endometriosis. I’d never heard that before and this wasn’t mentioned in any diagnoses previously. I then paid for a surgery as the waiting time was 2 years on the NHS and they found stage 3 endometriosis over my entire pelvic region. I had excision surgery a year after this diagnosis and then a year following that a total hysterectomy as the pain wouldn’t go. Thankfully I did manage to conceive prior to that decision, but I will never be able to give that child a sibling as a result. Endometriosis ruins lives and it’s not taken seriously enough. The treatments for it are contraception or nothing and now I’m in the menopause, it’s been extremely difficult to access information about this too. Women’s health deserves more attention and I hope that by raising awareness about the signs and symptoms of this debilitating condition, others may get checked out quicker and push for some early support. Living in constant pain is exhausting and it’s easy to feel alone, but no one with this condition is alone. We’re all here with each other, getting by as best we can.

I was diagnosed with a MRI scan followed by a laproscopy and have just had my 2nd laproscopy. My periods started aged 11 and they were extremely heavy. The pain was so bad to the point where I could barely walk. It was incredibly lonely as i was young and others around me led normal lives with their periods. Over the years, I learnt to manage enough to attend school/college/uni but it got to a point where I wouldn't stop bleeding for months on end. We trialled many pills and the injection over the years and settled on Nore with Micro with no gaps at all. These stopped my period but the pain and burning sensation was still around. After my first surgery I finally had a life but this was short lived and my symptoms started getting worse again. For a whole month I couldn't walk. My bowels weren't tolerating anything. The pain was only getting worse and I barely had a quality of life. I've now had my surgery with a Endo specialist and am hopeful about my recovery.

I was first diagnosed when I was 21 - I had been having heavy and painful periods since I first got them at 11 years old and was put on contraception to help but it didn't. I was constantly invalidated by doctors who told me period pain was normal. One doctor prescribed me with a high dose of ibuprofen for the pain. This ended up causing me to develop stomach ulcers as I was so nauseous from the pain I had been taking them on an empty stomach. At the hospital they did a laproscopy and I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis. At 22 and at 27 I had surgery to burn off my lesions but it always comes back after 6 or so months pain free. Aged 29 I started to develop severe IBS symptoms. The doctors ignored me when I said it might be related to my endometriosis and sent me down multiple paths including blaming anxiety, diet and my weight. I'm currently being investigated for endo lesions on my bowels after 3 years of being mucked around. My quality of life has been completely ruined, I barely leave the house these days because when I'm not in pain the week before and during my period I'm experiencing issues with IBS-D. I used to be outgoing, loved to party, meeting people, travelling but I feel like I'm a shell of who I used to be. Doctors think the only way to help me is a full hysterectomy, but I'm not sure I want an entire organ removed, it is a tough decision. I have had issues with many people disregarding my condition, even people who care about me have suggested I'm overreacting. A therapist told me it would be my fault if my partner cheated on me because despite being in pain I still must apparently meet his "needs" in the bedroom. Living with endometriosis has been painful but manageable for the most part until recently, but I find the hardest thing is other people's opinions, and how the pain affects my relationship. Hopefully something can be done eventually to prevent other women from living like so many of us do.

Periods started at 14, remember being on holiday on the beach, and just suddenly flooding my swimming costume and not knowing what to do. Had pelvic pain for months before, but it was brushed off. Saw over 30 different GPs in 14 years while trying to get diagnosed. Pain journals ignored or rubbished, requests for ultrasounds and referrals to gynae rejected. Just went through every hormonal contraceptive available, various painkillers. Ended up in A&E several times a year. Blood tests have shown severe anaemia for 15 years but been told it was normal. Last year, junior doctor doing GP rotation sent me for an urgent ultrasound. He was worried. Ultrasound showed one endometrioma. NHS gynaecologist refused to treat me. She belittled me during the appointment, telling me it's painless and that it's impossible for me to fill the largest size mooncups in 4 minutes. Went private, and they did an MRI for pelvic mapping. Four endometriomas on right ovary, varying sizes. Right ovary and right side of uterus stuck to abdominal muscle wall. Indications of endometriosis lesions on bladder and bowel. Left ovary appeared clear on the MRI, in normal position, but some adhesions may form in future. Now discharged back to GP because private gynae can't do anything else to help. Was genuinely quicker to get Dignitas approval than an endo diagnosis. That took nine months. Endo was almost fifteen years. Lost jobs over endo. Have no friends and no life because I'm unwell from it all the time. 16 days out of 30 I'm bedbound. I hate it.

My periods were pretty painful from about the age of 14, normal painkillers didn't make a difference but I assumed I was just sensitive to pain. I flooded on several occasions at school, embarrassing when we had pale summer dresses, so I ended up changing my clothes choices. In my early twenties I finally found a doctor who was willing to investigate. She sent me for an ultrasound which showed nothing so I believed it was not endometriosis. I got married and found sex incredibly painful which did impact our relationship. When I was in my early 30s, we wanted to have children, and found I could not conceive. We were referred on for infertility, and the gynaecologist said it was almost certainly endometriosis, and the ultrasound would never have shown it. When she performed a laparoscopy to check and treat, it was clear I had medium to severe endometriosis. I conceived my first child almost immediately. When they were about 9 months old, the pain came back, but after child number 2, I was given a Mirena coil which stopped my periods and the pain. No more writhing on the floor fantasising about stabbing my stomach to stop the pain! No more hitting myself to distract fro it. I was not a wimp, I was suffering extreme pain - having gone through childbirth with minimal pain relief the endometriosis was up with that.

I have struggled with horribly painful periods since I was around 13-14 which have worsened over time. I’ve been to the doctor so many times over the years, tried so many painkillers and contraceptive pills which gave me bad side effects, and was still struggling with my symptoms. My periods were getting longer and recently had been lasting from 10-14 days which was worrying me as the pain was also getting more unbearable. An ultrasound showed I had a polyp in my uterus so I decided to undergo surgery to remove this and asked the doctor whether this was causing my pain - she told me it was more likely a condition such as endometriosis, and that she could combine the surgery to remove the polyp with a laparoscopy to determine whether my symptoms were related to endo. Finally, nearly 15 years after my symptoms first began, I was diagnosed with endometriosis which thankfully was removed, along with many polyps from my uterus. I’m a couple of weeks post surgery at the moment and hoping to see a big improvement in my quality of life; if you’re worried about your period symptoms and pain, please don’t doubt yourself and keep pressing for answers.

I was recently diagnosed with complex endometriosis affecting multiple organs and I’m currently awaiting laparoscopic excision surgery. I’m at a high risk of losing one or both ovaries as well as at risk of needing a colostomy, which can be difficult to cope with. I’m lucky that I have such a fantastic multidisciplinary team behind me who is taking all my needs into consideration. I’m also going through the process of exploring egg freezing before my surgery which is exciting! Living with endometriosis can be lonely, but it’s the online community that makes it that little bit easier.

I was diagnosed with PMS, then PMDD after my mental health around my periods was unmanageable, also blended with periods that were so heavy I was unable to use lots of typical collection methods and pain that prevented me from being able to move or function. I dread my period each month, only getting about a week of peace which is followed by a week of pain and low moods, the period itself which can be up to 11 days (around this) which I am constantly bleeding on, then a week of organising myself back together. I took the pill but this led me to get "New Daily Persistent Headaches (NDPD)" - migraines which meant I had to stop the pill due to risk of stroke, so despite the pill helping my mood (not always the pain) I am unable to find a way to sort this out

I was diagnosed in 2019 after a lengthy battle to have my laparoscopy. They removed all the endo they could find and I finally felt free of depression and pain. And at first I was so happy to finally know what was wrong with me, I had closure. But now I am drowning in anxiety knowing I have endometriosis and it currently cannot be cured. I am in agonising pain again every month around my period which I know is only going to get worse as it progresses again. I feel like a burden to my fiancé and son as when I am in pain I am debilitated. I feel emotional and frustrated that this is happening to me. I am glad I know what’s wrong with, but I just wish there was more being done to find out why it’s happening and how to cure it, instead of covering up our symptoms

My periods have been awful since they started around 14, around 15 I was slapped on the pill (microgynen) there was no investigation as WHY. Afterwards I fainted picking them up at the chemist. Cut a year later where I was put on anti depressants (fluoxitine) due to anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. There was no check ups on me or my meds until I was about 23 they informed me my meds have increase chance of breast cancer (my mum had stage 3c breast cancer) first I decided to come off my anti depressants mostly due to emotional numbing (I could not be happy on them only numb or depressed) this was a horrific time, I struggled with withdrawal massively. When I realised that I still had all the same mental health issues (even after a lovely therapist) painful heavily periods, going from a size 6 to a size 14 (I only could poop once a week) acne covering my face, debilitating anxiety, I decided to ask my GP for help (I have NEVER had a good gp) they told me to try Yazmin. This is where I had what I would say mentally the worst time in my life. I developed some kind of psychosis, I was terrified of everyone/everything/everywhere. I felt like something was going to hurt me all the time, I thought my parents would die. I couldn't leave my house, if I did I would have panic attacks, I couldn't figure out what was real, I couldn't read/watch any of my favourite fantasy books/games because I thought I'd get confused what was real. I had a horrible sense of dread 24/7 and my life was constant panic attacks multiple times a day. I did not stay on this long and decided f*ck all this! No more birth control! And came off everything. This was 2019,every gp I spoke to told me "the pill doesn't do any of that" A weird time adjusting, slowly the dread and anxiety was clearing up, my periods didn't come back for a while and when they did they were manageable for a bit. Most of all, I learnt for the first time who me was! And wow! I cried so much from happiness, turns out I was a confident, happy, bubbly artistic woman. And she was wonderful! I just fell in love with her over this time, it was around covid and I had the time to finally find me for the first time in my life, turns out she loves wearing colour and not black baggy clothing, she paints her room bright blue and loves the sun. I couldn't believe my mental health, and I decided to go solo backpacking to Morocco and then Australia after covid where I had the best year of my life. Something previous me wouldn't have even crossed her mind. But then, the pain trickled back in slowly over time. My periods were weird and I just accepted it. I came back home to the UK after a year and they were getting worse over time, my mood was dampening and I found by October 2023 I was lugging through life, no one around me understood. And the stress and the isolation was mentally spiralling for me. In October I had 3 periods in a month, it wouldn't stop it was almost like when I had my bad period at 15 where I ended up bleeding for 4 months straight. I asked for an ultrasound with my GP who begrudgingly agreed finally, she seemed bored of me being there and continously told me it's a one off and I'm fine. I pushed. Thank god. Over this time I'm getting so much worse, the fatigue is everyday. I'm spotting. I dropped my usual yoga daily, my hikes my walks, connecting with nature, everything I loved. For now the pain is only on my periods, and every period is like a rusty knife gouging me open and burning up my insides, running all down my legs. Oh god the restless thighs could've sent me mad. I still got these pains on the pill but rarely. Now it was every period. I would cry on the floor of my kitchen begging why me? how is this normal? Why does no one care? And I'd have to go to work normally like everyone else. After the ultrasound, it took over a month to get my results back after constantly calling them and getting different excuses. Eventually the RECEPTIONIST told me "looks all fine but you could call a follow up appointment if you want" THANK GOD I did. I had a cervical cyst, it wasn't explaining my periods but it was explaining the constant spotting I had. So anyway they refered me to a gynocologist for treatment 6 month wait for a consultant. I was getting worse, now I had pain off my period, ovulation was horrible. Slowly over time I had pain peeing (a GP pushed for STI test and nothing else I tried to explain it's INSIDE and a pulling pain) constipation, painful sex, a bloating that never ceased. I started to not like looking in the mirror. I wouldn't say I'm religious but maybe I was sent an angel. My grandmother passed in this time, we had a beautiful funeral but I have a feeling this was her doing! Turns out she knew a gynocologist who I met. And she was wonderful and she saved me. But she was a 2 hour drive away and a different hospital. I tried to get my GP to move me but they would just copy and paste the same email telling me to wait until my 6 month appointment. My beautiful boyfriend found out about the Right To Choose service in the UK, if your appointment is a long time you can choose your own different clinic. So I replied to my useless GP "I would like to discuss my right to choose options with this, and if not I would like you to put your rejection onto my records" I woke up that next morning with a booked appointment. Within weeks, phone call consultations, blood tests and an an MRI was done. We had discussed possible PCOS and PMDD. But the MRI showed something much more severe. It turns out I have Stage 4 endometriosis and Adenomyosis that has spread via a large nodule all over my bowel. Before even a lap surgery. Unfortunately it's outside of my lovely doctors area so I am being referred again. Above all I want people to know do not put up with your horrible GPs there ARE good doctors out there. This disease feels so isolating, you watch everyone live normal lives while you try to just survive every day. It's unfair, we need a cure. My next steps are a refferal to another specialist and lap surgery.

I started my periods at age 10 which were heavy, painful & crippling. By age 12 I was put on the contraceptive pill without any investigation or concern why I was in so much pain. Over my teen years I continued to struggle with my periods, menstrual health, bowel & mental health. Missing so much school then having to leave half way through year 11 due to severe depression & sat my GCSEs from home. At 17 my symptoms were getting increasingly worse from painful, constant periods which lasted weeks on end, erratic & painful bowel movements & stomach issues, pain during/after sex, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, lower back pain, fatigue & insomnia. So I went to my doctors to spend the next 5-6 years being dismissed, fobbed off & gaslighted with being told I just had IBS, gluten intolerances, stress, part of being a woman & normal to have all these issues. I eventually had a GP listen to me after so many trips to the doctors & A&E to the point I countless jobs due to being so unwell. She referred me to my endometriosis specialist & in 2016 at 23 I was diagnosed on my first laparoscopy with endometriosis found on my left ovary & bowel. Since, I have also been diagnosed with adenomyosis, fibromylagia & had to have another four surgeries where endometriosis has been found, grown back & spread to not only my left ovary & bowel but also my bladder & womb. Endometriosis has fused my organs together resulting in my almost losing my left ovary, bowel & fallopian tubes leaving me with permanent organ damage. Not only is the condition itself aggressive & progressive, but the domino effect it creates with issues such as adhesions. On my last surgery in February this year, I had extensive adhesions from under my left rib all the way down to my pelvis. With each surgery the time frame between them has got slimmer & the relief is becoming non existent. My last 2 surgeries I have had to have privately due to the spread & regrowth of the condition, being proactive & having to pre-empt knowing my body means I have nearly missed losing organs or even further irreversible damage then if I had waited the long wait times for surgery. Living with the conditions has impacted all aspects from life, from my mobility, my fertility, my career, my mental & more. My dream of becoming a Mum is something that may not happen now due to fertility issues but also being so unwell that I don’t feel it is realistic to be able to fulfil that goal. I had to give up my job last year & heavily rely on my husband as my carer. I have tried everything to manage & live as best as I can with these conditions from chemical menopause, pain medications, treatments, procedures, holistic therapies & more.

I've had pain during sex, irregular periods and lots of pain during my period for most of my adult life. I have been fobbed off time and time again until last year I was finally listened to and referred to the gynaecologist. They suggested endometriosis but because of my BMI wouldn't refer me for a laparoscopy, instead gave me the mini pill. Was told I could come back within 6 months if it doesn't help my symptoms. After about 4 months and constant bleeding from the mini pill I decided to go back, only to be told I was misinformed and I only had a 3 month window to come back. I now have to be referred again and have been told it is now a 2 year waiting list. I have awful pain every month that is rather debilitating. Absolute joke.

I was lucky to be diagnosed at 19, I’d been having symptoms since starting my periods at 15. They were extremely painful, heavy and would be all over the place, I was advised different contraceptives for years and none of them helped my symptoms. I finally got a laparoscopy when I was 19 and was diagnosed with endo all over my womb, bowel, cervix and other areas. I was told to have a child to ‘fix’ my issues. Again very lucky to get pregnant at 24, had my daughter and now at 30 my symptoms are worse than ever. The coil used to stop my periods but don’t anymore, I bleed for weeks at a time and am in constant pain, extremely tired, have migraines daily. It’s hard living with all of this.

I'm at the very beginning of my endometriosis journey and am yet to be diagnosed. I've suffered with painful, heavy, long periods since I started at age 12 (I'm now 29!) I've managed the pain with ibuprofen and paracetamol (which has taken a toll on my stomach and bowels over the years) and GPs and nurses have only advised changes in contraception (like many other women, I've tried so many types now). On average, my periods last 10 days (but can be up to 16) and I experience pain and bleeding between periods every month. This costs a lot of money in period products, my anxiety levels are sky high, it's affecting my relationship because sex is so painful, and it's massively damaging my mental health. I have been to see a GP recently, and am now on a waiting list to see a gynaecologist. Thankfully I have a great support network around me, and my partner is amazing, but for me as an individual, I feel that my pain has been ignored and brushed aside for so long.

I was ignored by the Drs that I saw. They kept telling me I had IBS but I kept pushing for further tests. 4 years later I got a laparoscopy and I had it around my deep pockets in wrapped around my bowl, my pelvis, lower spine, and on my womb. Living with the symptoms before I got the coil were awful. Constant diarrhoea and stomach cramps which gave me no warning, life was taken away, I could barely leave the house, if I did there had to be a toilet close by. Then I got the marina coil which changed the symptoms just got a serve pulling pain. This was easier to live with, but no painkillers helped, I tried stronger pain killers like codine & naproxen, it was pointless, didn’t do anything. The pain was so severe. Now I’ve finally had a laparoscopy and the symptoms have eased but still getting the pulling pain.

after having my children in my 20's my periods became increasingly heavier and painful. i can remember one instance when my toddler found me on the bedroom floor in pain. thankfully my doctors were amazing and I was referred and ended up having a laparoscopy where it was found i had severe endometriosis and it was also stuck on my bowel wall. whilst under I had the mirena coil fitted (more on that later) slight complication after procedure in that my bladder stopped working so I had to have a catheter for a few days while it recovered so ended up staying rather than a day patient. The mirena coil has been my life saver, i have continued to have them fitted and I have not had one period since and no pain. For me it is slightly painful to have fitted/taken out as my cervix is tilted and I havent found a practitioner yet that has managed it on first attempt, in saying this it hasnt put me off as the benefits outway this. I am now using the coil as part of my HRT treatment

Took me 20 years to be taken seriously with my symptoms and it was only when I had a UTI for 3 months and I said my mum had a hysterectomy from endometriosis that I finally got referred. This was in 2016. The care from the consultant was terrible, claimed it was only IBS, finally had a laparoscopy in 2017 and was diagnosed with endo but discharged with no follow up or after care. Have been put on around 20 pills and the coil since I was 16, I stopped taking hormones when I was 39. Finally with an actual endo clinic where they care and are looking after me properly, have diagnosed fibroids which they found in 2017 but didn’t tell me about. They’re now trying to save my uterus from both endo and fibroids. It’s been shocking to live with!

In hindsight, i realize my period was never normal- i struggled with severely heavy periods as a young teen. Finally 10 years later, my heavy periods returned along with severe pelvic pain. Many appointments later, my gyno found ovarian cysts that should “go away.” They continued to grow until I begged for a surgery after becoming so sick that I could not longer function. they ended up discovering stage 3 endo. One month post laparoscopy and there’s still pain but i know it’s “technically not as bad” as before

It took me 13 years to get diagnosed. After countless doctors visits, multiple types of birth control, excruciating physical therapy, ultrasounds, tranexamic acid, hormonal pills, and against the advice of most of my doctor's, I finally got excision diagnostic surgery and a tubal ligation.

After 11 years of knowing that something was wrong, I was finally diagnosed with endometriosis. It was not an easy journey, it involved medical gaslighting, being told my pain was in my head, feeling guilt and shame even mentioning the pain I was in. The moment I was diagnosed I felt a sense of relief that I wasn’t crazy, and then I had the crushing sense of knowing that I had endometriosis. It’s a bitter sweet feeling, but at least I finally had answers. Getting a diagnosis was only possible as my parents were willing to pay for me to go privately due to the impact on my physical and mental health, I will forever be grateful to them for their help. I had to advocate for myself so many times, and asked specifically for excision after lots of reading. Whilst under I had a coil fitted too, in the hope that it would help with my symptoms. Since my surgery my quality of life drastically improved, I was able to go back to the gym and have a life again. Although slowly (1.5 years later) some of my more painful symptoms are starting to return. Although my coil does help, I still have a period every month so a lot of my symptoms continue to be cyclical. My luteal phase is hell, so much pain, I feel like the shell of the person I was. However I do have 1 good week a month which isn’t ideal but is better than nothing! I realise the burden I carry in day to day life, the consideration that has to go into going into the office, or going out for a meal - suddenly I’m packing pain meds, I’m thinking ahead to food options, I’m asking for decaf coffee and tea, I’m wearing bloat friendly clothing, maybe period knickers for just in case. However, ive learnt to be kind to myself, I’ve learnt to have empathy and understanding with my body which is a gift I’ve never given myself before. I’m super fortunate that my husband is the most amazing man and supports me through it all wholeheartedly, I know it’s hard on him, but he always has my back and is ready to pick up the slack when I’m struggling. It’s a constant struggle to not get weighed down by chronic illness, or overwhelmed by it all. No one understands unless they are going through it too, so it can feel a very lonely place.

Had horrible periods from starting at aged 10. Doctor put me on the combined pill from age 14 which helped a lot but I still had unexplained pain during sex and bowel symptoms. Then came off the pill at 24 and all my symptoms came back worse. Initially treated as IBS, then PID. Started TTC at 25 and needed a laparoscopy with endometriosis removal at 26. Got pregnant at 27 and now I have a beautiful baby boy!

I first went to see my GP about 8 years ago for awful digestive issues. It took four years for a diagnosis of “probable IBS” I was on the contraceptive pill for about 15 years before I made the decision during the Covid lockdown to come off it (combined) - until then I had never experienced any cramps, heavy periods or suffered from acne. These started almost immediately after coming off the pill and they were extreme. Accompanied by severe anxiety, very irregular periods and dreadful mental health. Now a few years on my symptoms are still the following; heavy flow, painful cramps, severe lower back pain, digestive issues, acne, cramping, ovulation pain. During an average period, on my heaviest day I pass clots hourly and I soak through 3-4 pairs of “heavy flow” period pants. However, My periods last for 7 days and are now fairly regular. I have gone back to the GP 3 times in the last 18 months. About 12 months ago I finally had a doctor who would listen and I was referred to OBGYN - I had an internal womb scan and nothing showed. My gynaecologist put me back on a progesterone only pill whilst I focussed on planning my wedding but now I am back off this and trying to conceive - with no success in the last three months. My next steps are to go back to my gynaecologist who has said they would be happy to do a laparoscopy if I want this. Also want to mention that my mum had endo, was ignored for 25 years - went in for a minor back operation and her endo was so bad (stage 4) it had attached itself to her major organs and she had to have a hysterectomy. My symptoms are sometimes manageable but at worst they are completely debilitating. On the really bad days I am unable to get out of bed.

I’ve been struggling for almost 30 years! Diagnosed with years ago after ending up in A&E with severe tubo ovarian abscesses, one surgery at home in the UK and things were too severe to do anything, another more major surgery at an approved endo centre and once again more surgery to come as things were too fused together! Stage 4 deep infiltrating diagnosis, possible adenomyosis and failed IVF attempt sadly

I was diagnosed in December 2022, after living with my symptoms since I was 12/13. I had no idea I had endometriosis, I ended up being referred due to pain in my bum (spasms) which started after I came off contraception in Jan 2020. I had an MRI to find out what was going on and that identified several locations of endometriosis and I was then offered surgery. After a wait of almost a year, I finally had my surgery at the end of November 2023, where they found deep endometriosis all over my bowel and rectom which was all excised. My symptoms are incontinence both bowel and bladder, however I’ve not yet got to the bottom of my bladder issues as the surgery didn’t reveal any endometriosis there. My pain mainly occurs in the 10 days before my period, during my period and a little bit after, I don’t have any other issues (bar the incontinence). I’m still recovering from surgery so in the early stages of knowing whether it will have helped or not.

When I finally spoke to someone I was luckily diagnosed pretty quickly, but it took me a long time to talk to someone following a bad experience with a male locum who didn’t want to talk about ‘female things’ with me. I’m lucky that after my initial treatment started to wear off that I was able to go private and be prescribed dienogest which for me is a miracle drug. There are side effects (weight, acne) but the pros outweigh the negatives for me. Having this time to look back I realise how debilitating and lonely having endometriosis can be. Planning every moment of my day around when pain killers would wear off was so normal for me I didn’t realise how draining that alone was.

I was diagnosed via laparoscopy in March 2015. I always had painful periods, painful ovulation and short cycles from the age of 12, in 2004. I thought the experience was normal because it was the same as my Mum’s. At the moment, I’ve had 4 laparoscopies. My symptoms are worsening significantly at the moment and I’m worried I need another surgery. Opiate pain relief is the only medication that helps and the side effects are unpleasant and make me incredibly tired. At the moment, endometriosis impacts my life on a daily basis but I know there is really very little that can be done to help.

I was diagnosed at 22, after seeing a doctor for 5 years and getting no where. I tried to take my life and knew something just couldn't be right. I have grade 3, I have had 3 operations, tried every treatment including zoladex to shrink a dormant cyst. I've had 2 miscarriages and finally have a baby after years of trying. It impacts everyday as the pain is that bad, and I can't take pain meds anymore due to looking after the baby

Still awaiting formal diagnosis, came off the pill after over a decade, very heavy periods that have left me with anaemia a few times, I take regular iron supplements. I find exercising regularly and eating well does help my symptoms through the month, more so the digestive symptoms, I experienced random stomach cramps throughout the day for no apparent reason, I have suspected bowel endo. During my period I cannot exercise, my pain wakes me up, I feel like I’m dragging a heavy sand bag around with me for at least 4 days, cramps range from strong aches and pain down the legs and jelly legs? To sharp lightening bolts and feeling like someone’s scooping ice cream out of my uterus. I am fortunate that my pain is more so around ovulation and my period so I can prepare and track it but sometimes get caught out with a burning pain for no reason?

I went to the GPs office in excruciating pain for 12 years before I was diagnosed. Various GPs kept putting me on the pill to help the symptoms but nothing helped. Once I came off the pill to try begin a family it was clear something was wrong. After 2 years of trying I paid to see a private GP who agreed to do a laparoscopy and found stage 4 endo. He said it was the worse case he had seen in 25 years of the job. I had my left tube removed, an induced menopause and now luckily have had 3 children.

I didn’t realise I had endometriosis until we were trying for our second baby. There were symptoms but I hadn’t realised e.g. back/hip/pelvic pain which I thought were linked to back pain from first pregnancy /looking after an infant. My periods before having my first baby had been exactly 28 days apart. After having a baby they started being 28-33 which isn’t a huge change but was a change for me plus the fact that I hadn’t got pregnant. I then got pregnant but had an ectopic pregnancy in the scar tissue of my previous c section. Following this, I went to the doctors with the symptoms that I had had. I was referred for an ultra sound. The results came and the consultant said that the ultrasound images were not clear enough so I had a MRI and from the results of this, I was booked in for a laparoscopy where they cauterised the endometriosis and after this I was lucky enough to get pregnant on my next cycle. My second daughter is 11 months old now. My periods seem to be quite settled and I haven’t had pelvic pain but I am keeping my eye on it to be mindful of it next time.

I was recently diagnosed with endometriosis after approx. 15 years of horrific period pain. For years I have spoken to different GPs about my pain but they just suggested changing contraception or prescribing different pain killers. My mother is a GP and both of us thought I had endometriosis for years before receiving a proper diagnosis. Even with her guidance and advice it took me about 15 years to get diagnosed. I was referred to different gynaecologists over the years, poked and prodded with no empathy or explanation for my pain. It eventually took Dr Simon Vaughan Jones (not sure if I’m allowed to name them here but he truly was amazing!) at the London Independent Hospital (on the NHS, darling) to arrange an MRI scan, which confirmed that I had endo. I now take the progesterone only pill back to back, which has stopped my periods, so I am pain free. But this doesn’t work for everyone and it isn’t a solution. My main concern is whether it will affect my fertility and ability to have children, but I’ve been told I won’t know that until I actually start trying to have children. So fingers crossed…

My pain, sharp like a thin knife in my vagina poking me so hard I was doubled up in pain. My GP said it would probably sort itself out once I had children. Years went by, I struggled on. I was in so much pain, my mum who had private health insurance through her job got me an appointment in Harley St. He diagnosed endometriosis and surgery happened a week later. Keyhole Laser surgery. Found it on my cervix and ovaries. Plus I had an injection which stopped my periods for 6-8 months. It allowed my body to recover. It also gave me a premature menopause, which was fun. Not. However my endometriosis was gone. Get help, we shouldn’t have to live with this !

Started periods at 11 in primary school and thought I was dying. I'd never felt pain like it or seen so much blood. 90% of my visits to the doctors have been about period pain affecting my day to day life. Since I was 15, I was put on the pill for pain management and I honestly can't recall if it helped as I've been on it all my adult life until coming off age 29. I'd cry after most conversations with the GP (I know they don't have much time so not GP bashing!) as I'd be asked the same questions like "are you using the pill for anything other than contraception?" YES! And was told different things about taking the pill back to back - that it's fine to do so and I don't need a break, that I MUST have a break every 3 months, or that I should always have a 7 day break. Since read up on The Lowdown's blog and know I was safe taking the combined pill back to back. I've been to the GP in tears on Christmas eve after laying crying on the bathroom floor in pain and was offered Mefanmic acid which didn't work for me. I've only had one GP say it sounds like endometriosis and they'd treat it with the pill anyway, so back to square 1 for me! "here, have another pill!" I've since come off the pill and feel better in my moods and can't say my periods feel any worse. It was nice not to have a bleed each month but I still had cramping and felt so bloated. So I feel like I've exchanged low mood for period pain. I don't know which is worse. How do you know when period pain is more than "just period pain"?

I started my period aged 14 and I started getting the worst period pains when I was 18. I had to be put on a contraceptive pill and given mefenamic acid and codeine to deal with the pain. Before I was put on this I use to be throwing up with the amount of pain. I only really get the bad baddddd pain on the first couple of days of my period and maybe a day before. I have had multiple ultrasounds and nothing has been seen so am now waiting for a laparoscopy.

I started having extremely painful periods at the age of 15. I had to be sent home from school every month, I was sick and didnt eat for a few days. I was given mefenamic acid and co-codamol but these did not help. 17 I started the contraceptive pill rivegidon. The period pain never got any better or went away. Then in October 2020 I had a laparoscopy and was diagnosed with endometriosis. The pain never stopped and I am now on my first injection of Zoladex and will need another laparoscopy soon. I find it extremely difficult to communicate with my friends and family and tell them how much it's affecting me. The fatigue is the worst symptom and it has stopped me from doing everyday tasks. I feel anxious about whether I will be able to have children or not. Even thought I am nowhere near ready at the moment.

Symptoms started shortly after I got my period, I had really heavy periods and lots of cramping. Symptoms were somewhat mitigated by oral BC for a few years, but I ended up having significant pelvic pain everyday, and I would get ovarian cysts that ruptured monthly which was awful. I had doctors suspect endo early, and they treated symptoms with birth control and then Norithendrone Acetate. I eventually got diagnosed via surgery with a pediatric gynecology surgeon. This was incredible validating, and hugely reduced my day to day pain.

Had excruciating period pain for as long as I can remember. At 26, I had daily pelvic pain that affected my day to day life. Opted for private laparoscopy that diagnosed and ablated the endometriosis. After 3 months symptoms were worse. Opted for endometriosis specialist surgery where they excised the endometriosis. Symptoms greatly improved. No more mid cycle bleeding, some shoulder tip pain, periods still painful and heavy but manageable.

I had symptoms from my very first period at the age of 13. My bleeding was so heavy that I used to have to set an alarm for every hour to get up through the night to change and clean up otherwise I would just soak through everything. The pain I experienced was so bad that I used to pass out and ended up in hospital many times. Doctors never investigated and kept saying its life as a woman and I need to get on with it, period pain is normal. I used to tell them it was like no pain I'd ever experienced but they constantly dismissed it. The pain during my period is still the worst pain I've ever felt. I could never go to the toilet without experiencing severe pain whether on my period or not, the toilet bowl used to be full of my blood, my periods were lasting 2 weeks as a minimum and the amount of blood I used to lose was scary. I'd get diarrhoea and vomiting as well. I was back and to with my GP. I'd been on different pills and every pain killer going but nothing touched it. I was on iron tablets for anaemia. My GP told me it was impossible that I was still in pain. I had tried every pain killer possible and nothing even took the edge off. I'd taken things for cycle control that just made me more ill. You name it, I'd tried everything and more. That should have been a red flag but they just continued to say it was impossible and I couldn't be in pain. I think they believed I was making it up. At the age of 19, I collapsed and was rushed to hospital. The pain was so bad I physically couldn't move. Once again, I was discharged with no investigation and told to follow up with my GP. I went to a different GP this time and she immediately said she suspected endometriosis. She was mortified at how I'd been treated the last 6 years and how no one had taken me seriously. I had ultrasound scans which showed nothing but I was also booked in for my laparoscopy straight away and of course, endometriosis was found between my womb and bladder. To anyone awaiting a laparoscooy, mine went great. I had minimal pain afterwards, it was more discomfort and I felt a bit off from the anaesthetic but it was all very minor. It was worth it as this is the only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis. This then started the experiment of finding a treatment that worked. After a few more years, I tried the injection. This has been the only thing that has helped me. I can't say I'm pain free but I don't have periods, just occasional spotting. The pain I do experience isn't often and is what I would imagine normal period pain to be like. I can go about my life finally. Its been 10 years since I was diagnosed and 16 years of living with endometriosis and it still seems it isn't taken seriously enough and too many women are dismissed as it being just "periods". The more awareness of endometriosis is out there, the better. Hopefully future women won't have to wait years for a diagnosis.

I have been experiencing extremely painful periods since I was around 14, I am now 25. I didn’t experience severe pain every month (approximately 3-4 times a year) but in some ways this made it more challenging to control as I never knew if I would need to take time off school/college/work. At age 18 I started on the combined pill after approaching a GP about my symptoms for the first time. At age 20 I swapped to the Mirena coil as my BP was elevated and I was experiencing migraines on my week off the pill. Symptoms were very well controlled for a year or two then started experiencing pelvic pain (period like cramps) 2-3 times a week. Was referred to gynaecology by my GP but it had resolved by the time I got my appointment. Approximately 2 years ago I started getting semi-regular periods again with cramps up to a week prior to bleeding. I went back to my GP and was re-referred to gynaecology. Had a pelvic exam, pelvic ultrasound, Mirena replaced with no improvement. Was referred for surgery 11 months ago with no word of when I’ll be seen. Pain is steadily becoming worse with me now being unable to stand/walk for 2-3 hours while the pain is at its peak.

Extremely painful periods since teenager, vomiting, fainting etc. Fatigue a lot of the time and bad mood swing the day before period due. Given painkillers and told by multiple doctors that it was nothing to worry about. Saw a gynecologist a year, who suspects endo. Did ultrasounds and MRIs but nothing showed up, don't want to have surgery just to have a diagnosis. Since then I've gotten the mirena coil which has improved my symptoms a lot.

I had my first laparoscopy in 2019 as part of ongoing fertility investigations and was diagnosed with PCOS. I had a second laparoscopy in 2011 and was told I also had endometriosis in the pouch of douglas with adhesions tethering my right ovary. The endo was lasered off but I was told it would most likely grow back in the future. Fast forward to 2019 I started suffering with very painful ovulation on my right hand side but scans were all clear. In 2020 my periods starting becoming very short, heavy and painful with significant clotting. Again, scans were all normal. I finally found a very understanding GP (Rebecca Mawson!) who listened to my concerns and we discussed various types of contraceptives to reduce my symptoms whilst waiting for a gynae referral. I've been taking Zoely for a while with some success and my long-awaited referral is coming up this month. Strongly suspect that my issues are being caused by adhesions/scar tissue and a reoccurrence of the endo I had lasered off 12 years ago. UPDATE Nov23: I had my consultation in October and was told that they 'don't remove endo or adhesions any more because it just grows back worse' and that I should try a different pill or the coil (even though he admitted the coil probably wouldn't help my pain). Was told to come back in 3 months, despite waiting 10months for the appointment. Back to square one and pretty frustrated! Also, can no longer get hold of Zoely so I've been prescribed Lucette - keeping my fingers crossed!

13 started periods. Very painful, heavy from the start so I didn't know any different. Very emotional, tearful, angry, boiling hot, greasy hair, spots etc.. Went to the doctors a couple of times in my mid 20s because very 3 weeks I was in agony. Couldn't walk, stand up straight. Male dr laughed at me when I said my periods are very painful - is there anything I could do? He said you are female, it's normal, what do you want me to do?? So i still thought this was normal - even my friends used to laugh at me when I was in pain. 1 day, I was in my own at home. Needed to drive to an job interview. I was in so much pain, I could hardly speak. I couldnt stand after my shower. I wanted to call an ambulance - but I didn't. I had that voice in my head. Call an ambulance for period pain - you idiot. So I didnt. I carried on as normal....struggling being me. We decided we wanted to try for a baby. I was 28. 4 years it took me to fall pregnant. When in labour the pain was the same as my 3 weekly period pains! That's when I was dilated 2 - 3 cm I now know that is not normal!! 2 failed pregnancies after my son was born. 1 was an ectopic pregnancy. Another Endometriosis problem! My son is autistic and very demanding. Once my periods started again I couldn't cope, physically and mentally. I went to a nurse which specializes in womens health. Explained everything....she prescribed me the pill which was great for the first 9 months. No periods, no problems. Then they started coming back and mentally I could cope again. I was loosing it every month. My temper was awful, I couldnt control it (verbally, not physically) She prescribed me a double dose of the pill and Sertraline, anti depressants. I had heard these can help as I suspected I had PMDD due to servere mood swings. I've been on this medication for 3 + years now and it has really helped I have a life whereas before my periods controlled me. I would only feel well / normal for 9 days of the month.

My symptoms started from my first period at 13. They were extremely heavy and painful to the point where I was always in the nurses office at school or taking days off. I was good that I would grow out of it when I was older. Several years of doctors appointment and I was just told to go on the pill and constantly being dismissed for my pain. I mentioned endo to plenty of my doctors and they said no you’re too young you’re fine. It wasn’t until around 2020 my mum got diagnosed with endo after a laparoscopy that they finally even considered the possibly that I could have it to. Fast forward to now. I just had my first laparoscopy at 20 years old, diagnosed with severe stage 4 endometriosis. I’m currently waiting for another surgery to remove said cells but as it has gone to my liver and diaphragm it’s going to be complicated and I’m trying not to think about it too much. I am in constant pain somewhere in my body. My pelvis area feels so heavy and temperamental. Just wish they listened to me sooner. The healthcare system fails to acknowledge that period pain is not normal !

I suffered with bad periods when I was younger, always bled heavy / passed out but didn't think much of it. I then went on Microgynon from the age of 16 and continued to take a contraceptive until the age of 27. I decided to stop and it took me 1.5 years to get my periods back. I suffered badly with hormones, they were all over the place, horrific fatigue, depression, pain, bleeding every 2-weeks etc., that all stopped me from working. I eventually got to see a doctor and was referred for scans / ultrasounds but nothing appeared. I then saw a private gynaecologist (I'm very lucky and get private healthcare through work - a godsend in this situation!), but sadly he just suggested going back on the pill, I was so desperate for it all to stop at this point that I did. I was feeling depressed everyday and was determined to figure this out the natural way so started doing my own research. I've been taking A LOT of supplements, cycle syncing etc., which has helped me get back my regular periods, but am still suffering a lot with the pain when they come. I've since been referred to a private gynae (very lucky) who specialises in endo and he's offered me a laroscopy in November which I am SO grateful for. I really feel for everyone suffering, it's absolutely ABSURD that we have to go through this as women and the research / care out there is really poor. I hope we start to see some big change soon.

So I am in investigation stages currently, I have had a few ultrasounds (was diagnosed PCOS a couple years ago) and on my last ultrasound in May 2023 the technician could see adhesions that has caused my left ovary to attach to my uterus, and have now finally after years been referred to gynocology, where hopefully will get MRI or laparoscopy, but I do not know how long the waitlist list is for! my symptoms have been getting increasingly worse each month, new symptoms coming on (last 2 months been having constant headaches and sinus pain), my periods last for 10 weeks (yes 10 weeks!) and they are heavy and during every period I end up aneamic! I’m almost constantly in pain now, and am dizzy and very tired often and I am struggling to stay at work and have had to reduce my hours, and every 2 months or so I am in so much pain I end up having a week or two off work, I can’t enjoy my days off as I’m too exhausted or in agony, it’s to be honest ruining my life, I’m beyond being able to handle the pain now, and I have had therapy because I was having panic attacks and depressed because of it and it did help but it’s getting worse and worse and to be honest am struggling to cope, no painkillers seem to help, I’ve tried so many things and I don’t really know what else to do in the meantime whilst I wait for my gyno appointment, it’s kind of indescribable how it feels to live with it, it’s very upsetting, I used to be a very laid back chill person and Im very smiley in the outside but it’s slowly taking my personality away, I just feel sad all the time now

Diagnosis took me 15 years in total from first seeing a dr for symptoms, but once I had heard about endo and learned about it, my diagnosis with drs was much quicker as I was armed with research on symptoms that were linked. I’ve had my first laparoscopy in April, 5 months later and my symptoms are worse than before. I believe this is down to bad surgery/not seeing a specialist, but that isn’t confirmed yet. Overall it can be very isolating and definitely hard for others to understand. Finding a community online or in person of other people with endo helps massively.

It took so long to be diagnosed (13 years) and even after my diagnostic laparoscopy where they treated endometriosis up to near my liver (during the 13th year), they are reluctant offer me further treatment and say there is nothing more they can do for me (NHS). It's frustrating and you feel alone

Since my periods started I always had very heavy clotty bleeding, severe pain (requiring tramadol amongst other things), nausea and sometimes vomitting. I would also get bad headaches. I often suffered with anaemia. I could bleed heavily for two weeks straight, have a few days of nothing and bleed heavily again for two more weeks. My periods have always been irregular. After 6 years going to and from the GP and trying numerous things to control the bleeding and/or symptoms I was finally referred to gynae at 18. I had an internal scan to rule out any kind of gynae cancer. I then tried yet another version of POP which didn't improve things. Finally they fitted a hormonal coil and this has been the only thing which has managed my periods (pain and bleeding) and ovulation pain. I no longer require strong pain killers when I have a period and usually I only get a light bit of spotting every so often. Sometimes I get some ovulation pain but it's mild compared to what I had previously. I'm on my second hormonal coil now and I've used the coil for symptom treatment for 7 years. I'm glad this has worked for me as I really didn't want to have any surgical procedures. It has been life changing.

I'm being investigated for endometriosis at the moment because a transvaginal ultrasound picked up a likely endometrioma on my ovary. While I've had painful and heavy periods since puberty and always suspected I had endo, I never bothered to look into it because I figured it would be invasive tests and the conclusion likely just putting me on hormonal contraception, which I'm already on. I only had this U/S scan because my GP recommended it after I developed bladder symptoms in the last few years. I mainly now just feel angry I have to go through long wait lists, MRI and possibly surgery just to get a confirmed diagnosis. We have to develop a better way to diagnose endo via blood test or biopsy... Why has it taken so long for the medical community to pay attention to this topic?

My main symptoms are chronic pelvic and hip pain. Having ruled out injury/ damage to the joints I was referred to a rheumatologist who suggested that we look into endo before going back to them. It took 2 years 3 months from referral to laparoscopy, not having actually met my gynaecologist until the day of my surgery. I felt that I was dismissed because I didn’t have a lot of the typical endo symptoms and even on the day of surgery my surgeon made a point of telling me that “you do know that in 50% of these we don’t find anything”. I felt that she was a lot more understanding after surgery when she had found endo in 3 sites (2 of which would have been causing my pelvic/hip pain). I had a hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, excision from 3 sites and mirena inserted during my surgery last week. We will have to wait and see how my physical symptoms progress, but I feel vindicated that what I was feeling and verbalising to professionals was real and that I do know my body and deserve to be listened to.

I’ve recently been diagnosed after several scans, I now await surgery. I was pretty disappointed when my GP ignored my symptoms back in January. I then became very sick in Feb/March time and was admitted with an ovarian abscess and since then the GP has had me referred under a great gynaecologist and I now await my laparoscopic surgery to help remove it. I’m feeling very nervous about it all as it’s also affecting my bowel and ureter. The pain is pretty debilitating and I suffer with bloating, stomach and pelvic pain most days. When it’s daily you start to feel pretty rubbish as it affects work and social life but I know I’m not alone.

I was diagnosed in May 2022 after 3 and a half years. I was 18 when my symptoms first started and was continuously told I had either IBS, pelvic inflammatory disease or was lead to believe my pain and symptoms were normal. I first knew something wasn’t right after having an ultrasound and finding my left ovary was adhered to my uterus. Doctors, GPs and nurses assured me this was normal, at the young age of 18. I’d had severely painful, and heavy periods all my life up until that time, but again, was assured this was normal and had never thought to question this further. I got into a relationship and quickly realised that intimate time was painful and uncomfortable, which ultimately impacted my relationship. During the pandemic my symptoms worsened. I’d been on the pill for 6 years to manage my periods, but this, I found, was detrimental to not only my physical, but mental health also. Mood swings and fatigue were, and still are things that I struggle with to this day due to this. In March 2021 I’d experienced severe pain during one of my periods, my mum took me to the doctors, despite being almost 20 at this time, in the hopes that having her with me to “vouch” for the severity in my symptoms would encourage doctors to take me more seriously. From this, I was admitted to hospital for 2 nights and 3 days on the specialised gynaecology ward. However, I was not treated for my symptoms, or even examined at this time, I was given fluids and antibiotics through a drip to combat my high temperature and “flu like symptoms”, as they described it. At this time I decided I would stop taking the pill. This helped my symptoms slightly, however my periods were extremely heavy, and I was changing my sanitary products up to twice every hour. After my stay in the hospital, I was referred for an outpatients appointment, which resulted in me being admitted to hospital once more. I was happy at the time, despite my symptoms, as I felt as though I was finally being taken seriously. However, after being on a ward for 24 hours, and finally seeing a doctor, he ushered me home with Buscopan tablets, as he was sure that I was experiencing symptoms of IBS, not those of endometriosis. Shortly after this, I was referred for an outpatients appointment, where I finally was booked in for an MRI scan. This revealed no abnormalities or complications, which, again, made me feel as though I was going mad, and all my symptoms were psychological. Luckily, I was seen by an amazing consultant who took all of my symptoms into consideration, listened to everything I had to say, without patronising me, and was referred for laparoscopic surgery. On the 23rd May 2022, I was (finally) diagnosed with endometriosis. My surgery revealed that I had several areas of stage 4 endo, my right ovary was adhered to my uterus, my large bowel was adhered to my pelvic wall, and my fallopian tubes were twisted. I finally felt listened to and almost wanted to shove those surgery notes in every doctor’s face who’d told me for 3 years that my symptoms were normal. Fast forward 18 months later, and I still struggle with my endo everyday. I have tried the coil, which was quite honestly, the worst decision I ever made, and I’m currently back on the pill whilst I explore other options.

I have had symptoms since starting my periods at age 11. I was not diagnosed until last year at the age of 45. Had surgery last April to remove endometrial growth. Had relief for a few months but am going to hospital tomorrow to start the process again. Considering a hysterectomy but unsure if it would help?

I had extremely painful periods from the age of 14, but every doctor I spoke to said it was normal. I was separately diagnosed with IBS, and then with vaginismus after talking to my GP about pain during sex. When I went for my first smear test, I was unable to tolerate the pain and this was the trigger for the doctor to refer me on to an Endometriosis clinic. I had an ultrasound and then an MRI scan, and through the MRI I was able to be diagnosed with endometriosis. At the moment, the medication I am taking reduces my pain to a minimum, but I experience high levels of fatigue daily, and some pelvic pain, lower back pain and aching muscles.

After 14 years of battling to be taken seriously by GPs, I had a really bad experience with a locum male GP who told me my pain was all in my head and to pop some paracetamol and get on with it. He said it was just something women should deal with and laparoscopies were too expensive for the NHS to do unless absolutely necessary and he didn’t think I was worth it. I of course lodged a formal complaint with the practice. At this point I spoke to my father about my period pains for the first time and he was horrified. He kindly offered to pay for me to see a consultant privately. The consultant spoke to me over the phone and within 15 mins said “I’m 99% sure you have endometriosis and you should’ve had the surgery years ago”. A few months later, I had a very successful surgery to remove my lesions which were on my uterus, bowels, bladder, and an ovary. It was such a relief coming out of surgery not only to have had the endometrial matter removed but to have been proven right after all those years - I hadn’t been mad or making it up. My pain was real and legitimate and I’d been repeatedly let down by doctors. My periods improved vastly following the surgery and I’ve never looked back. A year and half later I gave birth to my first baby. I do worry about endo returning but would redo the surgery in a heartbeat if it did.

I was diagnosed by laparoscopy surgery at the hospital recently. It feels scary to be diagnosed but I am glad that I finally have more understanding about my body.

I came off the pill last year. The last time I did that it took 12 months to get out of my system and on that day I was vomiting, diarrhea and excruciating pain. I was told (by my GP) that is just how my body reacts to PERIODS. Great right! When I started to get pain again, after coming off the pill this time, it was going to take over a month for me to get a telephone appointment with my GP. Luckily, I have private health care with my job, so I opted for that. It took me over 15 years to be taken seriously! They sent me for a scan straight away. It was confirmed that one of my ovaries is in the wrong place and the other is attached to my uterus. My uterus is also small and everything is over to one side. Now I have some decisions to make as to how I get this treated. I can have the key hole surgery which won't stop it coming back, but at least I will know what stage I have. And/Or I can go back on the pill or have the coil. I really don't want to opt for the latter because I've been on hormones for over half of my life and it is only since coming off them, I feel liberated as a woman! I have been looking at easing the symptoms through diet, I am hoping that it will help... But it's a working progress. For anyone reading this, my advice is to purchase a myoovi (other brands available-a TENS machine that you can wear with nobody knowing) and don't give up! My symptoms started 2 years before I even started my periods! Don't be gaslighted into believing that it's you with the "low pain threshold"! Keep pushing for diagnosis and the help that you deserve!

I was diagnosed a couple of years ago via laparoscopy. Had symptoms on and off for years but they were well controlled/masked by the pill/Mirena coil so it wasn't until I decided to stop taking any hormonal contraception after the birth of my first child that the symptoms were investigated. I don't have classic symptoms- periods are usually light and not that painful but I do suffer from chronic pelvic pain which is made worse by having any pressure on my stomach (I can't really wear trousers anymore because of it). I also get a lot of bowel symptoms although didn't have any bowel endo. Laparoscopy did really improve symptoms and I'm pain free most days now but still have to avoid any pressure on my stomach.

The one word I would use to describe trying to get an endometriosis diagnosis is lonely. In a word full of people I feel so alone. No one can understand the pain. When I had waited over a year for an appointment with a gynaecologist and finally had an appointment through, I turned up to the appointment for him to not even know why I was there! When I explained my Dr thought I may have endometriosis he told me I probably didn't before he had even heard any of my symptoms. When I explained my symptoms I was told they are 'normal'. It feels like a very long battle to try and be heard, but one which I will continue to fight.

I was diagnosed following laparoscopic excision surgery last year. Living with endometriosis feels like your body totally betraying you on a regular basis. I spent years (and often still do) gaslighting myself that my symptoms were either not there or not that bad; something which the lack of knowledge of medical professionals only exacerbated.

I’m waiting for a laparoscopy as through diagnosis by exclusion, urologists and gynaecologists have told me that I could have endometriosis. What I find most difficult is the range of symptoms because I feel like even when one things eases off, it seems as though the next is always beginning. A pelvic physio also explained to me that due to my pain, my pelvic floor is super tight which is creating new symptoms/ making existing ones worse. One of my best pieces of advice would be to see a pelvic floor physio. Through my experience of multiple GPs and consultant (some ok, some horrendous), both physios I’ve seen have been the only people who have really tried to ease my symptoms and explain them to me. Because they focus on the area as a whole, they have a much greater holistic understanding, instead of just picking and choosing which symptoms are most relevant to them.

I’ve not been diagnosed. But been having painful periods since I was young which would make me throw up. I was put in the pill for 10 years to deal with the pain but I decided to come off during covid. First period was really bad then they were painful but nothing compared to how they used to be. However this year they’ve got a lot worse to the point im back to being stuck in bed and throwing up headaches/ migraines and not being able to eat because I’m in so much pain.

Took over 10+ years to diagnose - constantly brushed off by GP. Had to fight to be placed on a Gynae waiting list. Lucky that I got surgery and diagnosed Feb 2020 before world went mad, but extremely let down on check ups/aftercare due to lockdowns. Symptoms- you feel lonely a lot of the time, I don’t know anyone else that has this and can’t be frustrating when you are sore/irritable and people don’t understand.

My chronic pain is unbearable in all muscles of my body - but espiecally my back/shoulder tips/legs and I just about get through the workday before and on my period. My fatigue, brain fog and metal health becomes very low during and before my period. In addition, my period blood is incredibly heavy for all days of my period and is very irregular and can last for 5 days of more.

Was diagnosed during transvaginal scan where they saw adenomyosis and my gynaecologist believes I have endo too but can’t diagnose without surgery. I had crippling period pain for over 20 years, no pain meds worked that effectively, I’d frequently be sick or pass out, and my entire life was planned around my period. Each month I’d suffer with low moods leading up to period as I’d be so scared about the pain I knew was coming. Symptoms started when I was 14 and I constantly had symptoms dismissed for years until I went private

It took four years of periods lasting up to seven months at a time before taken seriously, given multiple contraceptives and pain killers. The doctors at one point tried to pin the pain on my mental health and tried to say it could be phantom pain due to past traumas,this felt like a massive blow. My mental health spiraled, the chronic pain was debilitating. The main thing they have tried to push from day one was the hormonal coil, which I refused the doctors have always fallen back on why don't you get the coil having also known my past traumas they still could not understand why I did not want such an invasive contraceptive . When I started my diagnosis journey I was only 17, getting ultrasound's, internal and external, smears and pelvic exams I was met with no support from my doctors and through every stage felt I was not being taken seriously until I'm assuming they caved from years of appointments they agreed to a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in attempt to burn the diagnose and potentially burn away the tissue. They managed to burn away Alot of tissue but as it's on my lower organs it was not 100% successful. So still battling the issue today, but then found the lowdown, completed the survey and have been on the injection ever since. It's completely stopped my periods and endo flare ups! So for now we're manageable!

I had to ask my GP about it, after 5 years of being cycled thru a ridiculous amounts of birth control options like I was a guinea pig, and to my frequent protest. Eventually I went abroad to get a proper scan and see a specialist as both an NHS referral and a private consultant took a long time here. I don't feel that there's a real treatment out there, or at least one that has worked for me, it makes one feel defective, especially where women who haven't heard of it constantly question why you feel so off on your period or whether you're exaggerating.

It took several GP visits over several years before I was taken seriously. I was told it was 'bad periods' and to take painkillers and it would all be ok. It took forcefully asking for a referral to the gynecologist a 'clear' ultrasound sound to get that. From there I had a laparoscopy which confirmed endo. Since then I've had multiple appointments and tries multiple medication but there hasn't been much help from the NHS following the diagnosis.

I waited too long before seeing a doctor - endo has affected all the women in my family so I knew it was likely on the cards for me but I waited until I couldn’t cope anymore before talking to someone about it. I wish I had spoken up earlier instead of suffering unnecessarily for fear of not being believed. Do not let anyone dismiss your pain. It is VERY real and NOT normal

When I get my period, within an hour I am doubled up in pain, crying despite having a period patch and taking ibuprofen. I’ve had an ultrasound that didn’t show anything and I was told there was nothing else that could be done until I hadn’t got pregnant within 6 months of trying. I’m exhausted all the time and anxious about missing work&school because I’m scared to get caught outside with the pain. I feel as if I am skewered on a pole, with needing to get up frequently to go to the toilet.

Diagnosed when I was 23 from a laparoscopy which I had to pay for privately as NHS were unable to help. Symptoms started when I was 13 and affect my life massively. Not a day goes by when endometriosis doesn’t impact me. Feels very lonely as no one is able to help.

I have had symptoms of endometriosis since I started my periods at 10. I thought these excruciating period pains were 'normal' however, as that's what most grown ups told me. I went back and forth to my GP with IBS symptoms from the age of 17 to 36, but never felt like I got anywhere. The only thing that helped a bit with my bowel problems, terrible bloating and stomach pain was giving up gluten. I tried the low fodmap diet a few years and found my stomach was sensitive to so many foods that I could only eat a few fruits, vegetables, rice and potatoes, but I can't stick to that everyday! I also saw GPs and gynecologists from about 18 onwards complaining of incredibly painful sex. I experienced this at 16 and 17, but kept believing it was typical pain when young and would get better. It didn't get remotely better till I was 25 and I still get some pain, though reduced, in my late thirties. Most doctors dismissed it as a 'psychological problem'. Over the last few years, I've seen gynecology specialists more and more. I suggested it was endometriosis as it runs in my family, but each one doubted it as they couldn't see anything from internal examinations or an ultrasound. This year, I luckily had enough money for a private consultation as my stomach issues, painful bladder symptoms, period pain, pelvis and ovulation pain and pain during sex had become unbearable. I don't know how I held down a job. If I didn't get enough rest each weekend and didn't have a supportive partner, I don't know how I would've coped. It has had a massive impact on my mental health too. Anyway, in April this year, at 38, I finally had a private laparoscopy and was diagnosed with endometriosis. The surgeon said he had to excise multiple deposits, so I knew I wasn't imagining things! I still got symptoms but I think I'm beginning to heal and hopefully will find the most suitable birth control to mask some of the pain. I can't believe in 2023 so many people have to put up with this. I hope that more research and treatment gets approved, the more awareness there is and the more we speak out about this condition that affects so many.

I took 10 years for a doctor to finally listen to me and acknowledge my symptoms. Mentally that took a real toll and ultimately led to the breakdown of 2 long term relationships. Finally having a diagnosis and excision surgery was so affirming, even if I will likely continue to have symptoms for life.

In summer 2021 I began my period and it didn't stop. I had been on the contraceptive implant for around 2 at that stage, and hadn't had any issues prior. From June to August I bled a small amount each day. It was too much for a liner but not enough for a sanitary towel each day. I had experienced pain during sex or uncomfortable physical sensations during penetrative sex for a few years but thought I was just not relaxed or doing something wrong. I contacted my GP (via eForm as it was covid times!) and they suggested I could have an STI (sexually transmitted infection). Given that I have been with my partner in a very trusting committed relationship for four years at that point, I was very concerned that we had had a dormant STI which could have impacted both of our health. STI check came back clear, and the nurse at the sexual health clinic suggested I pop onto the pill for 3 months to 'regulate' my menstrual cycle. This worked but the pain during sex didn't, and I noticed worsening period pains. In January, my long periods returned and I returned to my GP. They did a pelvic exam, and a swab, and everything seemed okay. I got referred for an ultrasound in May to see if I had any growths or fibroids - that all seemed okay too. I was referred finally for a gynae appointment at my local hospital for September, and over summer my symptoms were still bad but I felt like I would be wasting NHS time and resources -- surely it was just period pains and my implant acting up! THANK GOODNESS I kept my appointment and went along. The surgical registrar did a physical exam and I shouted out in pain as he did it. He immediately stopped and checked that I was okay, and checked if I wanted to continue with the exam. I felt really supported. Afterwards, he said that that sort of pain during a physical exam as well a the discussion of my symptoms was an indication that I had endometriosis! Something I had heard of and knew a fair amount about, but had not ONCE considered! I agreed to go on the waitlist for surgery for a laparoscopy so that they could investigate internally and confirm the diagnosis. I had my pre-op in February and went for my surgery in March 2023. It was confirmed that I had 'extensive endometriosis on the uterosacral ligaments and ovarian fossae. Before I bleed during my menstrual cycle, I get really deep pelvic pain, lower back pains, and cramps that can take my breath away (and wake me up in the night!) for about 2-3 days before I start my bleed. I then have cramps and back pain during the first few days of my bleed. I often then finish my period, stop bleeding for about 7 days, and then start bleeding again and have a small/light follow up period for another 5 days. I then have a varied 3-5 weeks before my next period. I also experience much worse cramping and pain during what I imagine is my ovulation as it's about 10 days to 2 weeks before my period. I experience a deep pelvic pain during sex, but at least quite uncomfortable and feelings during.

I’ve had symptoms of endometriosis for as long as I can remember and like most, was always dismissed by GP’s, claiming it was just normal and inevitable. I finally went through my private healthcare insurance and saw an amazing consultant. I had an ultrasound, results containing an ovarian cyst and a surgery date within weeks. When my surgery date came around, my surgeon could clearly see my deep endometriosis and was able to remove this, as well as the cyst. Recovery was quick and fairly pain free and since my endo symptoms have improved drastically. It’s honestly been an absolute god send and not only taken away the consistent pain I was in but helped to reassure my initial concerns and given me an opportunity to monitor reproductive health that otherwise could’ve been ignored

I was officially diagnosed last year after surgery but it was spotted on an ultrasound which was picked up on during a visit to A&E in 2020. despite having the surgery last year my endo pain has gotten a lot worse. In July I ended up in a&e again as I had issues with my mobility which stemmed from the flare up I had. I am with a pain clinic now and I’ve been given pregabalin to help with the pelvic pain. I have struggled to contact my hospital when I needed help when I was in serve pain. I can have weeks or days where I’m pain free but I can get some baseline pain for months which leads into a flare up where I have to leave work sick. My manager is very understanding. I started a new job in March and I have taken over 4 days off for pain. I’m taking co-codemal for pain which can cause me to be constipated and cause me more pain, so I try my best to not take it and only take it when I’m in a lot of pain. My relationship with my boyfriend has been impacted as he’s basically my carer when I’m having a flare up.

I was diagnosed after a laparoscopy in June this year when endo was found just underneath my left ovary, which has been causing me a lot of pain. The endo did not show on a previous ultrasound scan and I was told by a gynaecologist before my surgery that he definitely didn’t think I had endo so I was quite surprised when it was found. My symptoms have improved since the surgery but they do seem to be starting to come back 3 months later.

It took 11 years to get a diagnosis, more gp trips than I could count , 3 surgeries and countless hospital admissions. At the age of 24 I’ve been put into a medical menopause . It’s a strange mixture of relief and disappointment.

I was diagnosed after continuing sharp stomach pain and symptoms which couldn't be explained by any of my pre-existing conditions. I pushed to speak to a gynaecologist who didn't strongly feel like it was endometriosis, but said that there could be a remote possibility and if I wanted to definitively exclude it, that she could do a laproscopy. The laproscopy found a few mild patches. I feel like I like from period to period with each one lasting around or over 7 days from when I start a little bit of bleeding, then slow down, then full blown heavy bleeding with significant pain that takes my breath away. The fatigue is constant and worsens duing my period. Even those the patches are 'mild', they don't feel mild and even though the gynaecologist used ablation on the patches, my symptoms are very similar to prior to the surgery, but the difference is the understanding of what is causing it.

My symptoms started off fairly moderate and I was more concerned about what was causing them. But over a few months they worsened and got to the point where the cramps and nausea caused me to faint, which then led to anxiety. Initially seemed like GP was invested in helping, referred for scans, blood tests etc, then once it was assumed endo it felt like being cut off entirely. I got a text saying "no further action required" and a prescription for COCP which I've previously been told not to take due to migraine plus my mum having had a bloodclot. So disappointing that nothing more can be done and support just isn't there.

I started my periods aged 10 and was having a week off school every month due to pain. Given the contraceptive pill aged 11 which gave me my life back. My period pain returned aged 28 and I knew straight away something was wrong. I had painful / heavy periods, painful ovulation and sex also became painful. When they found Endometriosis on my first laparoscopy, I felt relieved there was finally an answer. I had two laparoscopies to remove Endometriosis. I always get short term relief but my symptoms return. My symptoms are currently the worst they’ve ever been and now involve bladder and bowel pain. I’m constantly fatigued and needing to take time off work to rest. My latest MRI showed Adenomyosis, an endometrial ovarian cyst and an ovary stuck to my bowel. It’s important to know that Endometriosis rarely shows on scans so don’t take negative findings as proof you don’t have it. Living with my symptoms is hard. This is made worse by NHS wait times which means getting help takes a long time. We know our bodies the best and if you suspect Endometriosis, keeping pushing for answers. Painful periods are not normal and we shouldn’t be left in debilitating pain.

My mother has endometriosis so when I showed similar symptoms I was taken to a gynaecologist who said I had suspected endometriosis. It is very hard to get out of my bed or do simple tasks when on my period which can last up to a month which makes living normally hard.

I was diagnosed 4 months ago through laparoscopy. I had surgery under general gynae. My symptoms have worsened since, and I believe I should have seen a specialist instead. Living with these symptoms is just exhausting.

My diagnosis took forever. As a teen my GP sent me for an ultrasound for abdominal pain but once my periods started I was told it was normal period pain despite being doubled over in pain. My older sister was diagnosed so I went back to my GP and said I believed I had endo, my GP agreed that I probably did but as I was coping they wouldn’t refer me for investigation. My endo was only finally diagnosed when I had a 17cm ovarian cyst removed and I was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It took three years of being under oncology before they referred me to the endometriosis clinic and now I’m on a long waiting list (over 12months) for surgery.

Always had some level of pain during my period, sometimes fever during the period (sign of high inflammation). I was on the pill for several years which masked most of the symptoms but migraines and body aches were always present during and around the period. I placed the IUD and no signs of anythingout of the ordinary during the eco. Periods after the iud (no hormonal) were awful. Always minimized as “normal”. In 2020 during the pandemic I started to have intense incapacitating levels of pain which were made worse by the stress and anciety at the time and going through a burn-out. Got an emergency consult and they suspected the iud shifted somehow and was causing the pain. I did an ultrasound (vaginal) and during the exam the technician said there were clear signs of endometriosis. Two endometriomas in each ovary and abnormally enlarged tissue in other areas. Got diagnosed and told to go on the pill which I refused. Also recommended to take off the copper iud and replace with hormonal which I didn’t want either. i did some research and waited for a long time to be seen by a specialist. In the meantime I did pelvic floor physical therapy which helped tremendously with managing my pain, bowel and blatter symptoms, changed diet and did low impact exercise. After two years I got a consult with a specialist. We did an exam and the endometrioma grew a lot so I’m up for surgery. Removed the iud as suggested by her. She strongly recommended the continual use of the vagina ring (ornibel) without pause to avoid bleeding. I’m currently waiting for a consult with a surgeon, have to do an MRI and a pannel of blood work. How it impacted my life? A lot. Started to plan around my the expected worst times of the month. Very low energy, lots of reactions with certain types of foods. Pelvic floor pt helped a lot with pain and managing pain. Pain levels are low but brain fog and fatigue are high! Can’t do certain activities I liked to do before because I get tired and can have a flare-up. O feel something wrong inside. It has interfered with personal lfe and work. Financially also it takes a lot (I take probiotics, omega3 and CBD to help manage) and the vaginal ring is quite expensive. Endometriosis has impacted my life a lot.

I was diagnosed privately by MRI because the NHS refused 4 times to do a lap to diagnose me because it 'was too invasive'. It cost me around 2000 pounds in the end. My symptoms have become fairly bad, they impact me every day and are now unrelated to my period because the endo is on my bowel, ligaments and I also have adhesions attaching my bowel to my uterus. I feel completely failed by the NHS and have been waiting for a consultation for over 15 months. I can no longer exercise, go to gigs or walk more than about 7k steps and commuting gives me pain without fail. My diet has had to be radically limited as dairy, red meat and gluten all give me flares.

The pain during periods is extremely difficult to cope with, but it’s how it affects other aspects of my life, I get pain before my period so when I know I’m due, for a couple of days before that I will cancel plans, avoid socialising etc in case I am in sudden extreme pain. The other most difficult thing is trying to get a doctor interested in investigation, I have not had endo diagnosed. I’ve gone from doctor to doctor and been prescribed strong NSAIDs, then moved onto the pill and trying to get them to actually investigate the cause of my pain has been near impossible for me.

When I switched to a menstrual cup, I realised how heavy my periods were. I then began to connect other long-time symptoms, such as extreme pre-menstrual and menstrual pelvic/back/groin pain; permanent bloating that worsens pre-menstrually and menstrually; and pain that does not respond even to opioid painkillers but only extreme heat (e.g. hot water bottle). I went to my GP and asked for a referral, and he advised to try the pill while waiting for the referral, as my symptoms were unbearable. I have since been dismissed, gaslit and told my case is not worth lengthening the waiting list for.

For 10+ years I've been attempting to get a diagnosis for something (at the time I didn't even know it was Endo) it want until I started doing my own research this year (2023) that I went to my doctor and specifically had to ask. She was hesitant and dismissive but I got an ultrasound and it was confirmed. The doctor that delivered the results actually praised the other doctor for sending me for the ultrasound but little did he know I had to forcefully ask for it. I was due 3 months later to be referred but that was cancelled and moved another 6months down the line but what's 9more months for an appointment it's been so long already. It depresses me that I won't be the last woman that suffers for this length of time, that we're years and years away from women's menstrual health being taken seriously and I worry about my future, the damage this wait has done to my uterus and potentially the risk of not being able to concieve.

I was 13 when my symptoms started and after years of going to multiple doctors, doing multiple exams and attempting multiple treatments, I was finally diagnosed at 24 years old. The relief! I then started """treating""" it with progestogen-only pills, and my body did not take them well at all. Now, I've been actually treating it with a nutrition-based approach and the results have been amazing! However, I've been really struggling with IBS (which I was diagnosed with at 19 – 5 years before my endometriosis diagnosis). But I believe I'm on a path of healing now, after struggling for more than 10 years with "invisible" diseases. Imagine a 13-year-old hearing time and time again that her cramps were normal and would go away after she had kids! Unbelievable! The fact that both are invisible diseases makes it really hard for people who do not have it to comprehend the extent of it and to believe you when you say you are in pain. I can finally say that I now have a team of health professionals and of supportive friends and family that have been helping me get through it.

I first went to the GP with bloating and pain when I was 15. I didn't get diagnosed with endometriosis until I was 35. I was misdiagnosed with IBS for my bowel symptoms. I was put on the pill for period problems. I was told it was anxiety that caused my fertility issues and that getting pre-eclampsia during my first pregnancy was just 'one of those things'. In 2021 I bled almost for an entire year. I had an NHS scan that suggested I had a polyp. I had a hysteroscopy where they found nothing. After a long time of pushing the gynaecologist agreed to send me for a MRI- to "rule out" endometriosis. The MRI showed I have deep infiltrating endometriosis affecting my bowel. I have a severely retroverted uterus that is attached with adhesions to my colon. I have been referred to a BSGE centre and I am now awaiting excision surgery and also a hysterectomy because they also identified adenomyosis on my scan. It's been a long journey and there is a long way ahead of me still.

Diagnosed by chance during a laparoscopy to remove a dermoid cyst from my right ovary. Was good to know the cause of so many years of unanswered symptoms but it is frustrating to know there isn’t a cure. I’ve just had a baby so no symptoms at the moment but pre pregnancy I was taking painkillers everyday and struggling a lot with the bloating and bowel related issues.

Diagnosed through emergency surgery for what turned out to be a ruptured ovarian cyst (presented at A&E with extreme abdominal pain and vomiting). Surgery a year later. Now waiting for another surgery 7 years later as symptoms are worsening again. I was diagnosed young (21/22) after having symptoms since around 14 - very painful periods being the main one. I find endometriosis very isolating, and found it more so when I was younger. I now try to be quite open with managers, friends etc about what symptoms I suffer which does help with the isolation but can be difficult to navigate (I work in a male dominated field!). My mental health suffers every period, and the wait lists on the NHS are really tough to mentally deal with. The current waitlist for my surgery is 12 months. I've been under the care of two different endometriosis specialist units due to moving and they have both contained the most helpful, empathetic, understanding medical professionals I've come across - I feel very lucky for that.

I was diagnosed by going to a private gynaecologist for an ovarian cyst, once they symptoms for that didn't disappear, endometriosis was mentioned. I had a discovery surgery which included ablation, the mirina coil was put in and I was sent on my way. I honestly thought that was it, I'd had the surgery, got the coil, I was "fixed." But my body expelled the coil twice, and I researched endometriosis more and found out that the gold standard for endometriosis surgery should be excision. So when my symptoms came back, I found an NHS endo specialist (because I'm no longer covered with endo privately due to it being a chronic illness) and after 6months had excision surgery. I was pain/symptom free from that surgery for about 10 months in August 2022, I am now waiting for an MRI scan at the endo centre at John Radcliffe hospital, that will then lead to my 3rd surgery. Looking back, I started having symptoms of endometriosis at 13 years old and had a ridiculous amount of GP visits, scans, tests etc. before I was diagnosed at 28! Living with endometriosis is extremely difficult, and I've had to change my life drastically since my diagnosis. I changed careers to one that was less stressful, I stopped drinking, I have to carefully plan out my days/weeks to try and prevent flare ups on important days (like weddings etc.) I do have a better understanding of my body now, and my menstrual cycle and can manage the symptoms a bit better, but it's taken 3 years to do that.

I was diagnosed in Dec 22 after going to my first doctor about the symptoms in 2018. I was repeatedly told it was an STI, and consistently sent to Sexual Health clinics for STI tests. It took me 4 different doctors to finally get to a women’s health physio who send a letter of recommendation to my GP for me to be seen by gynaecology. I am on the waitlist for my first surgery. It’s challenging living with symptoms as it really affects my relationship as I cannot have penetrative sex as it is too painful however my partner is extremely understanding but I still struggle with it.

I am awaiting a laparoscopic surgery, it’s taken me such a long time to secure it. None of my doctors have ever believed me or listened to me when ive told them about my symptoms. I was diagnosed with PCOS 2 years ago and now i’m experiencing this pain they just don’t care. I am in constant pain, either puking or diarrhoea every single day, im almost fainting, passing blood and decidual cast. I’m taking time off of work, it affects my every day life and stops me from doing normal activities and i’m constantly exhausted

Constantly pushing for help, don’t give up keep asking. Had 3 laparoscopy’s to diagnose/remove but still dismissed by gyne as I’m supposedly fixed but suffering now more than ever. It affects my relationship as sex is so painful, I have an understanding partner but we both find it frustrating. The tiredness is so overwhelming I come home from work at 5pm and need a nap, I think constantly trying to mask my symptoms adds to this. I’m trying now to be more open & honest to help others understand how I’m feeling.

I was diagnosed after pushing my GP for a gynaecology referral. I had been experiencing severe period pain requiring me to use pain killers, hot water bottles and a tens machine to even tolerate it and had also been experiencing pain before my period and very prolonged periods lasting up to 30 days for years. I ended up having to go privately for my diagnosis as I couldn’t wait for the year and a half it would take to even have my first specialist appointment on the NHS. I had laparoscopic surgery in April which went well and confirmed my diagnosis, since then my pain has been reduced massively, I still have long periods but me and my gynaecologist are working through my options to prevent that currently. Before my surgery I was really struggling with my symptoms, the pain would be so bad some days that I couldn’t go out and I was bleeding so much that it was making me anaemic and incredibly fatigued. Since my surgery my quality of life has really improved, I no longer have to take regular pain medication and I haven’t had to get my tens machine out in months. Having a good gynaecologist that listens to my symptoms and works with me to try to resolve them has been very positive for me, my GP had been consistently dismissive but now that I’m being seen by a specialist I feel like my voice is being heard.

I feel like my life gets put on hold from every time I ovulate, until I've finished my period. The symptoms are highly disruptive, both physically and mentally and also have a significant impact on my relationship with my extremely patient husband. Despite my GPs being firmly of the opinion my symptoms point to endometriosis, I was dismissed by a gynae professional after minimal investigation, which was extremely disheartening and had a very negative impact on my mental health. I haven't had an official diagnosis of endometriosis and haven't pursued this again as I currently can't afford to go privately, and don't wish to go through the horrendous NHS wait list again when I'm well aware that treatment options will remain very limited even if diagnosis is confirmed.

My symptoms started with a nagging pain in my right hand side. I was twice sent to A&E by my GP as they thought it could be appendicitis. They found nothing and a few years later I stopped contraception. When my periods didn't return and I still had the same pain, I got a referral to gynecology and was diagnosed with endometriosis after a laparoscopy. I still do not feel that I really know how this affects me. I tried different pills but felt these affected me mentally so tried the coil which was slightly better but still had side effects. Lower back and pelvic pain are my most common symptoms and when bad I can get extremely bloated.

I was diagnosed fairly quickly (a year) after the pain got so bad I was unable to work. But getting help and subsequent surgeries after diagnosis has been extremely difficult. Sadly I'm confined to my flat and unable to work. My bowel symptoms are the worst, and totally unpredictable. I use a wheelchair to get around when I have to get out for appointments and the like.

I was diagnosed in February 2020 when I had been in pain for 3 months. My GP thought I was constipated after going to the doctors 3 times in the space of 5 weeks. Another GP noticed the symptoms and called the hospital for me so i could have a bed for the night. They found a cyst that was 5cm on my left ovary. I was discharged from the hospital 2 days later, as they believed the cyst would burst in 6 months. 1 week later I am still in pain and I go to another hospital after being in hospital for 5 days in immense pain I went down for surgery. After I was told I had stage 3 endometriosis and they have had to take out my Fallopian tubes as the endometriosis had destroyed it. They found endometriosis in my bladder and bowls. Now in 2023 I have not had surgery since and have been messed around my the gynaecologist department at one hospital and have been referred to another hospital. In the last 3 years I have had to be very careful with my diet and what I can and can't eat and drink. I have been on numerous pain medication which made the pain worse for myself. I live with the chronic illness now

It took me 15 years to get a diagnosis after being dismissed by many GPs and even several gynecologists. I had a laproscopic surgery at 18 and they told me there was nothing wrong but the surgeon that ended up diagnosising me at 29 said they clearly missed it as they didn't know what it looked like. I think doctors should not be making definitive statements or conclusions (dismissing all symptoms) when their skills or knowledge about it ends because the women's symptoms don't end. It's a tiring journey and I hope more can be done with managing it

Struggle to be taken seriously by doctors who told me to lose weight, checked for ibs, suggested appendicitis when I was admitted to a and e and said it's just "part of life as a woman". As soon as I was referred to Liverpool Womens, I was listened to and had a laproscopy and diagnosis within 3 months! They really looked after me and made me feel heard for the first time in so long. My symptoms are mostly period related - I get very intense ovulation pains and heavy bleeding with cramps throughout. Some days I just want to stay at home curled up. But since my diagnosis things have improved. I feel better having a label for my pain and I'm grateful that my mini pill is helping so far.

I first got symptoms in 2017 when I came off the cerazette contraceptive pill as I’d been on it for a number of years and thought I was experiencing some side effects from that. I stopped taking it around September, my first period maybe a few weeks after that was horrendous. I was at work (paramedic) in a patients house and I bled through a super plus tampon, a super pad, and my thick green trousers in the space of an hour or 2. It was awful. I’d also been getting pain during sex and horrendous cramps. I also noticed my hip joints were clicking a lot and sometimes it would only half click and get stuck and I couldn’t move. I made a GP appointment and I was very fortunate they were very good and referred me for an U/S and to the gynae team straight away. My ultrasound however showed nothing. I was seen by the gynae team in February and was arranged to have an investigative laparoscopy, again I was very fortunate and I got a cancellation spot at the end of March for my surgery. The intense pain after the procedure was something I hadn’t been warned about and was the worst pain I’ve ever felt, I’m told it was the gas trapped from the procedure. I was diagnosed with stage 2 endometriosis. I opted to not have the mirena coil because we wanted to start a family, so went back on the pill. It prevented my heavy bleeding which was great but only a few months after surgery the pain returned with a vengeance. I often found my pain was worse late evening/ overnight which made shift work very difficult. Some days I would have pain in my hips so bad I couldn’t stand up. This continued for several years, I would manage the pain with codeine which helped me just to sleep through the flare ups. Due to a change in other circumstances we didn’t try for a family until last year, however I was extremely lucky and found myself pregnant within 4 weeks of stopping cerazette and before I’d had a period! Fast forward to now 5months post partum. Exclusively breast feeding, I’ve had 1 period about 4 weeks ago and it was the best period I’ve ever had- mild cramps the day before, 1 day of very heavy bleeding but all done in 5 days. I am now late for my next one but I wonder if that’s because I’m breast feeding. But overall my symptoms have not returned yet and I’m going to try to continue breast feeding for as long as I can because I think that’s what is preventing the endo!

My life got plagued from 16-32 with multiple doctor visits and no answers. I got put on the pill and in my final gyno appointment I was pressured to fit a coil with no investigation work done until I pushed for it. The coil has stopped my periods and given me a better quality of life but I finally received my diagnosis after surgery last November, which was invaluable to my mental health.

So, not sure I have endometriosis yet. But have been investigated for pelvic pain and this was one suggested cause. I had an ultrasound scan, where they think there were some signs of adenmyosis but not yet sure about endo. To be honest, it's quite scary thinking that I might have endo. I know so many women who really struggle with this, and find that the symptoms get worse the closer they are to menopause.
